For this document, we demonstrate how to use the `{quarto-stamp}` extension to add information regarding how Quarto rendered the document to the document itself.  

We're using the following options:

- `level: minimal` to show only the bare minimum sections
- `placement: custom` to place the stamp anywhere in the document
- `placement-id: a-stamp-id` to specify a custom placement ID

# A section before the stamp

Content before the stamp.

:::{#a-stamp-id}
:::

# Another section after the stamp

Extra content after the stamp.
